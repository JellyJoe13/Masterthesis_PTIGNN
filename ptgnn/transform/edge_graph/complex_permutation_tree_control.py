# todo:
#  - detect which stereotype is to be invariant to or to be distinguished?
#  - depending on selection do different things:
#     + mark all nodes as Z
#     + mark only stereocenters as Z
#     + mark all as C (preserves structure but disregards stereocenter)
#     + fuze two nodes neighbors to fix enantiomers via = bond
#     + vertex graph permutations
#     + higher level of message passing (seperate edges/nodes interconnected with lower level)
#  - further business:
#     + permutation tree with multiple element appearances
#     + separate permutation tree by graph transformation
#     + add edges/nodes (enantiomers with multiple stereocenterns or cycle chirality)
#  - for all: tests on capability in notebook
#  - general task: measure influence of different trees on performance in datasets
